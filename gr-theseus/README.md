# gr-theseus

Gnuradio module that provides GRC files and block controllers to
represent the RFNoC blocks in [fpga-rfnoc](../fpga-rfnoc).

[12/12/2018] Functionality provided here does not require any custom
gnuradio blocks (yet). We will fill out the rest of the cmake workflow
when we are required to compile code here. TBD later!
